If Brangelina were capable of being the IT couple of the 2010's for celebrities, why can't Rhyton be the IT couple of the 2020's for coding???

Yes, I know the word "code" itself may seem daunting, and putting 2 of them together to form a hybrid of some sort might even seem like your worst nightmare! But I promise, it's not as bad as it seems. 

Now, I'm not going to say it's easy and that everything you need to learn about it can be done within a week. Rather, if I had to put it into an analogy of some sort, think of coding as a form of new type of language that you're trying to learn. In that - it not only takes time and energy to learn, but you also need to keep practicing on how to do it pretty much every single day. However, although that may seem pretty bad to begin with - as you keep practicing and working on it, it gets easier and easier to do (just like learning a new language!). And so, with practice, you can actually become fluent in R and Python. So let's start with the baby step of combining the two worlds together!

## Practicing with R and Python

And so, when I mean baby steps of combining R and Python - I mean BABY STEPS. Basically, we're going to be doing the absolute bare minimum so that I don't actually cause you to exit out of my website. So in order to combine R and Python together - we actually need to install a package from our library called "reticulate". It's basically just a package that allows R and Python to work together within this server. 

After installing the package, we're going to start off with r coding. And so, we're just going to create a name for "Rhython" - and we're just going to save it under "computational". 

```{r}
library(reticulate)

computational<-"Rhython"
```

Next, we're going to do the same thing but in Python. And so, we're just going to create a name for "Endgame" - and we're just going to save it under "biology". 

After doing this, the next step that we can do now is combine the two codes together, aka: Rhython! Now, in order to do this, we just use the 'print' code to put the two names that we saved under 'computational' and 'biology', to get the results that we need. However, one thing to make sure is that - whenever you have an r-code that is combining with a python code, you always need to add a 'r.' in front of the r-code so that it can be ran within the python chunk. 

And so, after doing all that, you should be left with the name Rython Endgame (which it totally obviously is haha)!

```{python}
biology="Endgame"
print(r.computational,biology)
```

Additionally, another way to go about combining R and Python - is by going the R-code route. In which, we add something to the python code so that it is able to run within the r chunk. Which in this case, we would have to add 'py$' to the front of the python code. 

```{r}
cat(c(computational,py$biology))
```

And just like that! We have combined R and Python together!
